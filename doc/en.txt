* Added a keyboard shortcut to move focus to list of group threads. By default, this function is assigned to the ALT+6 combination. Please note that often when pressing the enter key on the group that we want to open, the list of threads may not be displayed and then it is necessary to set the focus on this group again and press the enter key. As a rule, after the second press, a list of threads is displayed, and after that we can press a key combination that will move the focus to this list.
* Now the ALT+2 combination moves the focus not only to the list with messages, but also to the open profile, to the open list of group threads, or to the open section with settings.
* Now in the UnigramPlus settings, you can disable the pronunciation of the phrases "Admin" and "Owner" on messages in groups.
* Combinations for accepting and rejecting calls now work correctly.
* Now the automatic announcement feature for new messages and the chat activity will not turn off when NVDA is restarted, but will work until you turn it off yourself.
* Improved display of some interface elements.
